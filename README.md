Bluetooth car is mainly a simple RC Car that is mainly controlled over Bluetooth Protocol. An Arduino Bluetooth Module HC-05  is necessary for controlling the car over Bluetooth signal through Android Device.

Tools Required for Wireless Car control system based on Arduino UNO R3:
•	Soldering Iron
•	Glue Gun
•	3RD Hand for Soldering.
•	Arduino UNO
•	TT Gear Motor
•	65MM Wheels for TT Motors
•	HC-05
•	18650 Battery
•	2S, 18650 Battery Holder

•	L293D Motor Driver
•	Switch
•	Jumper Wire
•	10MM RED LED
•	8MM White LED
•	180R Resistor
•	Double Sided Tape
•	Wire for Motor Connection



APP USED TO CONTROL BLUETOOTH CAR:Ardino Blutooth car controller
Code implementation: using c++
Software | Arduino https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

NEW LEARNINGS:
       We got to know lot of information by working with the Hardwares for the first time. We learnt how hardware and software interact with each other and learnt few tasks like soldering and working with electronic components like Arduino, Motor shield, etc.
